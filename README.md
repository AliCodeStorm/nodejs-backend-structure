Node.js Backend with Express.js - Modular Architecture 🚀
Description 📝
This is a Node.js backend application built using Express.js following a modular architecture. The goal of this project is to implement best practices for backend development, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and testability. The application is structured into multiple modules (controllers, services, repositories) to ensure clean separation of concerns.

Key topics covered in this project:
🛠 Modular Routing for API organization

🔌 Dependency Injection for loosely coupled services

⚠️ Error Handling through middleware

📂 Optimized Folder Structure to support scalable applications

Features ✨
🖥 Express.js server setup.

🏗 Modular architecture: Controllers, Services, and Repositories.

🔄 API routes for CRUD operations (users, products, etc.).

🚨 Centralized error handling using middleware.

📈 Scalable and maintainable codebase.

🎮 Sample routes for demonstration (you can add more based on your requirements).

Tech Stack 🧰
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for backend development.

Express.js: Web framework for building APIs.

MongoDB (or other databases): For data storage (if used in the application).

Nodemon: For automatic server restarts during development.
